3. Knowledge gaps: Does this question address important learning objectives?
4. Learning outcomes: Will completing this question advance student understanding?

Evaluation metrics:
- progression_score: 1-10 (fits well in learning sequence)
- difficulty_match: 1-10 (appropriate challenge level)
- skill_building: 1-10 (builds on prior knowledge)
- outcome_value: 1-10 (advances learning goals)
